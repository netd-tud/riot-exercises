# RIOT in the Internet of Things - Exercises

## Overview

Collection of practical exercises, assignments, and tasks to become familiar
with IoT technologies using Linux and RIOT-OS.

This is a version of https://github.com/inetrg/exercises
adapted for the hardware kits used at TU Dresden.

## Getting started

Go through the exercises starting with [`00-getting-started`](./00-getting-started/README.md).
Each exercise contains a `README.md` with detailed instructions and tasks to solve.


## Conventions
Throughout the tutorials, we will specify commands and outputs.
The conventions are as follows:

**Leading `$` means that the command is executed on the Linux shell:**
```sh
$ make
```

**Leading `>` means that the command is executed on the RIOT shell:**
```sh
> help
```

**No symbol means an output from the RIOT node on the terminal:**
```sh
Command              Description
---------------------------------------
echo                 Echo a message
```
